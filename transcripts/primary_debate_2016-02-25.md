Thank you. My whole theme is make America great again. We don't win anymore as a country. We don't win with trade, we don't win with the military.
First of all, he was in charge of amnesty, he was the leader, and you can ask Marco because they've been debating this every debate that we've had. As far as coming back in, number one, you wouldn't even be talking, and you wouldn't have asked that as the first question if it weren't for me when my opening when I talked about illegals immigration. It wouldn't even be a big subject. But, we either have a country, or we don't have a country. We have at least 11 million people in this country that came in illegally. They will go out. They will come back — some will come back, the best, through a process. They have to come back legally. They have to come back through a process, and it may not be a very quick process, but I think that's very fair, and very fine. They're going to get in line with other people. The best of them will come back, but they're going to come back through a process. 
Well, I'm very glad that Ted mentioned Arizona because probably the toughest man on borders is Sheriff Joe Arpaio, and two days ago he totally endorsed me, so, thank you. 
Well, first of all, self-deportation is people are going to leave as soon as they see others going out. If you look at Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s, they started moving people out and the rest of them left. Self-deportation, as I really define it, and that's the way I define it, is you're going to get some to go, and the rest are going to go out. As far as the people that I've hired in various parts of Florida during the absolute prime season, like Palm Beach and other locations, you could not get help. It's the up season. People didn't want to have part-time jobs. There were part-time jobs, very seasonal, 90-day jobs, 120-day jobs, and you couldn't get. Everybody agrees with me on that. They were part-time jobs. You needed them, or we just might as well close the doors, because you couldn't get help in those hot, hot sections of Florida.
I criticized Mitt Romney for losing the election. He should have won that election. He had a failed president. He ran a terrible campaign. He was a terrible candidate. That's what I criticize Mitt Romney — I mean, ran...
Excuse me. He ran one terrible campaign. That's an election that should have been won. 
No, no, I'm the only one on the stage that's hired people. You haven't hired anybody. 
And by the way, I've hired — and by the way, I've hired tens of thousands of people over at my job. You've hired nobody.
You've had nothing but problems with your credit cards, et cetera. So don't tell me about that.
You haven't hired one person, you liar.
That's wrong. That's wrong. Totally wrong.
I've hired tens of thousands of people over my lifetime. Tens of thousands...
Be quiet. Just be quiet. Let me talk. I've hired tens of thousands of people. He brings up something from 30 years ago, it worked out very well. Everybody was happy.
And by the way, the laws were totally different. That was a whole different world.
But I've hired people. Nobody up here has hired anybody. 
I can only say this, and I've said it loud and clear and I've said it for years. And many of these people are sitting right in the audience right now — your lobbyist and your special interest and your donors, because the audience is packed with them, and they're packed with you. I've had an amazing relationship with politicians — with politicians both Democrat, Republican, because I was a businessman. As one magazine said, he's a world-class businessman; he was friendly with everybody. I got along with everybody. You get along with nobody. You don't have one Republican — you don't have one Republican senator, and you work with them every day of your life, although you skipped a lot of time. These are minor details. But you don't have one Republican senator backing you; not one. You don't have the endorsement of one Republican senator and you work with these people. You should be ashamed of yourself. 
Here's a man — Robin Hood. This is Robin Hood over here. He talks about corruption. On his financial disclosure form, he didn't even put that he's borrowed money from Citibank and from Goldman Sachs, which is a total violation. He didn't talk about the fact that he pays almost no interest. He just left it off, and now he's going to protect the people from the big bad banks. Give me a break.
.
Correct.
I will, and the wall just got 10 feet taller, believe me. It just got 10 feet taller. I saw him make that — I saw him make the statement. I saw him use the word that he used. I can only tell you, if I would have used even half of that word, it would have been national scandal. This guy used a filthy, disgusting word on television, and he should be ashamed of himself, and he should apologize, OK? Number one. Number two, we have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion a year. And that doesn't include all the drugs that are pouring across and destroying our country. We're going to make them pay for that wall. Now, the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion, if I do it. If these guys do it, it'll end up costing $200 billion. But the wall is $10 billion to $12 billion. You need 1,000 — you need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago — 2,000, is 13,000 miles. We need 1,000, because we have a lot of natural barriers. We can do it for $10 billion to $12 billion, and it's a real wall. This is a wall that's a heck of a lot higher than the ceiling you're looking at. This is a wall that's going to work. Mexico will pay for it, because they are not doing us any favors. They could stop all of this illegal trade if they wanted to...[ bell ringing ]... immediately. Mexico will pay for the wall. It's a small portion of the kind of money that we lose and the deficits that we have with Mexico. 
Well, you know, I don't mind trade wars when we're losing $58 billion a year, you want to know the truth. We're losing so much. We're losing so much with Mexico and China — with China, we're losing $500 billion a year. And then people say, "don't we want to trade?" I don't mind trading, but I don't want to lose $500 billion. I don't want to lose $58 billion. Mexico just took Carrier Corporation, maker of air conditioners. They just took Ford. They're building a $2.5 billion plant. They just took Nabisco out of Chicago. And I always say I'm not having Oreos anymore, which is true, by the way. But they just took a big plant from Nabisco into Mexico. They're taking our businesses. I don't mind.
Such a cute sound bite.
All right, you know what?
Because they devalue their currency — they devalue their currencies...
... that makes it — well, you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything...
Let me just tell you — they de-value their currency. They de-value their currencies.
That makes it — well, you don't know a thing about business. You lose on everything you do.
Let me just tell you, they de-value their currencies. China, Mexico, everybody. Japan with the cars. They de-value their currencies to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them, our workers lose their jobs...
But you wouldn't know anything about it because you're a lousy businessman.
No, I — and you know why? You know why? 
You know why?
First of all...
... first of all, that's called a...
And by the way — and by the way...
... and by the way...
... I've won most of the lawsuits.
And they actually did a very good job, but I've won most of the lawsuits.
Excuse me. Hey Wolf, let me ask you. Am I allowed to respond to this?
OK. Well let — no, I haven't. I really haven't. 
Here's a guy — here's a guy that buys a house for $179,000, he sells it to a lobbyist who's probably here for $380,000 and then legislation is passed. You tell me about this guy. This is what we're going to have as president.
No, no, no.
 I took...
That is so wrong. We'll work on that. I took $1 million and I turned into $10 billion.
I borrowed $1 million...
I borrowed $1 million, I turned it into $10 billion...
... more than $10 billion.
I have to say, he lied this time. He lied. 100 percent. 100 percent.
Yes, yes, yes. 38 years ago.
True. 
True.
No.
First of all, I don't believe anything Telemundo says.
Number one. Number two, I currently employ thousands of Hispanics, and over the years, I've employed tens of thousands of Hispanics. They're incredible people. They know, and the reason I won in Nevada, not only won the big one, but I also won subs, like, as an example, I won with women. I won with every single category. I won with men, I won with high-income, low-income, I won with Hispanics. And I got 46 percent. Nobody else was close. Because they know I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from so many other places. They get it. They're incredible people. They're incredible workers. They get it. And I've won many of the polls with Hispanics. I didn't maybe win the Telemundo poll. But one thing I'm also going to do, I'm going to be getting — bringing a lot of people in who are Democrats, who are independents, and you're seeing that with the polls, because if you look at anywhere, look at any of the elections, every single election, it has been record-setting. And the good news is, for the Republican Party, the Democrats are getting very poor numbers in terms of bringing them in. We're getting record-setting numbers. I think I have something to do with that. We're getting record-setting numbers. And I won every one — the three of them that I won, I won with record-setting numbers.
New people are coming into the Republican Party. We are building a new Republican Party, a lot of new people are coming in. 
I love them. I love them. 
They're fine. Do you know what? They're fine.
Why did they take the poll? Why did they...
I'm just telling you, I'm doing very well with Hispanics. And by the way, I settled my suit, as you know, with Univision. It was settled. We're good friends now. It was all settled up. Very happy, very happy. Very good people. I'm just telling you — I'm just telling you that I will do really well with Hispanics. I will do better than anybody on this stage. I have respect for the people on the stage, but I will do very well with Hispanics. But I'm telling you also, I'm bringing people, Democrats over and I'm bringing independents over, and we're building a much bigger, much stronger Republican Party.
Yes, I would. And I've been there. And I've been there very strongly. I do have to say something, and this is interesting and it's not anybody's fault. It's not Ted's fault. Justice Roberts was strongly recommended and pushed by Ted. Justice Roberts gave us Obamacare. Might as well be called Roberts-care. Two times of the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts approved something that he should have never raised his hand to approve. And we ended up with Obamacare. That is a rough thing. And I know Ted feels badly about it. And I think he probably still respects the judge. But that judge has been a disaster in terms of everything we stand for because there is no way — no way that he should have approved Obamacare. Now, with that being said, these are the things that happen. But Ted very, very strongly pushed Judge Roberts, and Justice Roberts gave us something that we don't want.
Well, let — let me — let me just say — let me just say this. Look, I watched Ted — and I respected it, but he gets nowhere — stand on the Senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk. I watched the other senators laughing and smiling. And when Ted was totally exhausted, he left the Senate floor, and they went back to work. OK? We have to have somebody that's going to make deals. It's wonderful to stand up for two days and do that. Now, Ted's been very critical — I have a sister who's a brilliant...
... excuse me. She's a brilliant judge. He's been criticizing — he's been criticizing my sister for signing a certain bill. You know who else signed that bill? Justice Samuel Alito, a very conservative member of the Supreme Court, with my sister, signed that bill. So I think that maybe we should get a little bit of an apology from Ted. What do you think?
When you say crazy zealot, are you talking about you? Crazy zealot — give me a break.
Well, let — let me just say — let me just say, first of all, I have great respect for Justice Scalia. I thought he was terrific. And if you talk about evolving, Ronald Reagan was a somewhat liberal Democrat. Ronald Reagan evolved into a somewhat strong conservative — more importantly, he was a great president. A great president. As far as Planned Parenthood is concerned, I'm pro-life. I'm totally against abortion, having to do with Planned Parenthood. But millions and millions of women — cervical cancer, breast cancer — are helped by Planned Parenthood. So you can say whatever you want, but they have millions of women going through Planned Parenthood that are helped greatly. And I wouldn't fund it. I would defund it because of the abortion factor, which they say is 3 percent. I don't know what percentage it is. They say it's 3 percent. But I would defund it, because I'm pro-life. But millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood. 
I just want to say, I agree with that 100 percent, except pre-existing conditions, I would absolutely get rid of Obamacare. We're going to have something much better, but pre-existing conditions, when I'm referring to that, and I was referring to that very strongly on the show with Anderson Cooper, I want to keep pre- existing conditions. I think we need it. I think it's a modern age. And I think we have to have it. 
I think they're wrong 100 percent. What we need — look, the insurance companies take care of the politicians. The insurance companies get what they want. We should have gotten rid of the lines around each state so we can have real competition. We thought that was gone, we thought those lines were going to be gone, so something happened at the last moment where Obamacare got approved, and all of that was thrown out the window. The reason is some of the people in the audience are insurance people, and insurance lobbyists, and special interests. They got — I'm not going to point to these gentlemen, of course, they're part of the problem, other than Ben, in all fairness. And, actually, the Governor too, let's just talk about these too, OK? Because I don't think the Governor had too much to do with this. But, we should have gotten rid of the borders, we should have gotten rid of the lines around the state so there's great competition. The insurance companies are making a fortune on every single thing they do. I'm self-funding my campaign. I'm the only one in either party self-funding my campaign. I'm going to do what's right. We have to get rid of the lines around the states so that there's serious, serious competition.
... And, you're going to see — excuse me. You're going to see preexisting conditions and everything else be part of it, but the price will be done, and the insurance companies can pay. Right now they're making a fortune. 
That's going to solve the problem. And, the insurance companies aren't going to say that, they want to keep it. They want to say — they say whatever they have to say to keep it the way it is. I know the insurance companies, they're friends of mine. The top guys, they're friends of mine. I shouldn't tell you guys, you'll say it's terrible, I have a conflict of interest. They're friends of mine, there's some right in the audience. One of them was just waving to me, he was laughing and smiling. He's not laughing so much anymore. Hi. Look, the insurance companies are making an absolute fortune. Yes, they will keep preexisting conditions, and that would be a great thing. Get rid of Obamacare, we'll come up with new plans. But, we should keep preexisting conditions.
... And, you don't know what it means...
You don't know.
... The biggest problem...
... The biggest problem, I'll have you know...
... You know, I watched him meltdown two weeks ago with Chris Christie. I got to tell you, the biggest problem he's got is he really doesn't know about the lines. The biggest thing we've got, and the reason we've got no competition, is because we have lines around the state, and you have essentially....
... You don't know much...
... The lines around the states...
... and, it was almost done — not now...
... Excuse me. Excuse me.
... You get rid of the lines, it brings in competition. So, instead of having one insurance company taking care of New York, or Texas, you'll have many. They'll compete, and it'll be a beautiful thing.
The nice part of the plan — you'll have many different plans. You'll have competition, you'll have so many different plans.
No, no, no. [ and cheering ]

 I watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago...
I watched him meltdown on the stage like that, I've never seen it in anybody...
... I thought he came out of the swimming pool...
I tell the truth, I tell the truth.
... We're going to have many different plans because...
... competition...
There is going to be competition among all of the states, and the insurance companies. They're going to have many, many different plans.
No, there's nothing to add. [ cheering and ] What is to add?
I do not want socialized medicine, just so you understand. He goes around saying oh, he wants it. I do not want socialized medicine. I do agree with him that it's going to be a disaster, Obamacare, for the economy. In 2017, it will be impossible for us to pay for it if you look at what's going on. That's why it has to be repealed, for a lot of reasons, Number one, it doesn't work, number two, premium. You look at premiums going up, 25, 35, even 45 percent, and more. We have to get rid of Obamacare. It is going to destroy our economy completely. Our economy is not doing well. It is going to destroy our economy greatly. And on that, I agree.
That's false.
No, I said it worked in a couple of countries...
No, I did not. No I did not.
Correct. I will not let people die on the streets if I'm president.
Excuse me. Let me talk. If people...
If people — my plan is very simple. I will not — we're going to have private — we are going to have health care, but I will not allow people to die on the sidewalks and the streets of our country if I'm president. You may let it and you may be fine with it...
... I'm not fine with it. We are going to take those people...
Excuse me. We are going to take those people and those people are going to be serviced by doctors and hospitals. We're going to make great deals on it, but we're not going to let them die in the streets.
You know what? Call it what you want.
Call it what you want, people are not going to be dying on the sidewalk.
Because the country will become a dynamic economy. We'll be dynamic again. If you look at what's going on, we have the highest taxes anywhere in the world. We pay more business tax, we pay more personal tax. We have the highest taxes in the world. It's shutting off our economy. It's shutting off our country. We have trillions of dollars outside that we can't get in. Yes, we will do my tax plan, and it will be great. We will have a dynamic economy again.
We're going to make many cuts in business. We're getting rid of — we're going to get rid of so many different things. Department of Education — Common Core is out. We're going local. Have to go local. Environmental protection — we waste all of this money. We're going to bring that back to the states. And we're going to have other many things. We are going to cut many of the agencies, we will balance our budget, and we will be dynamic again.
Waste, fraud and abuse all over the place. Waste, fraud and abuse. You look at what's happening with Social Security, you look — look at what's happening with every agency — waste, fraud and abuse. We will cut so much, your head will spin.
I just want to say — and I'm a big fan of the governor, but they also struck oil, OK, so that helped Iowa a lot.
All right. First of all, let me just explain. I was the first one to file a financial disclosure form — almost 100 pages. You don't learn anything about somebody's wealth with a tax return. You learn it from statements. I filed — which shows that I'm worth over $10 billion. I built a great company with very little debt. People were shocked, the people in the back, the reporters, they were shocked when they went down. And I filed it on time. I didn't ask for five 45-day extensions, which I would have been entitled to. So as far as that's concerned, I filed it. And that's where you find out what kind of a company. You don't learn anything from a tax return. I will say this. Mitt Romney looked like a fool when he delayed and delayed and delayed. And Harry Reid baited him so beautifully. And Mitt Romney didn't file his return until a September 21st of 2012, about a month-and-a-half before the election. And it cost him big league. As far as my return, I want to file it, except for many years, I've been audited every year. Twelve years, or something like that. Every year they audit me, audit me, audit me. Nobody gets audited — I have friends that are very wealthy people. They never get audited. I get audited every year. I will absolutely give my return, but I'm being audited now for two or three years, so I can't do it until the audit is finished, obviously. And I think people would understand that.
Are you going to ask anybody else that question?
Every single question comes to me?
I know I'm here for the ratings, but it's a little bit ridiculous. 
True.
No, I'm not. First of all, very few people listen to your radio show. That's the good news. Let me just tell you, let me just — which happens to be true. Check out the ratings. Look, let me just tell you something. Let me just tell you something. I want to release my tax returns but I can't release it while I'm under an audit. We're under a routine audit. I've had it for years, I get audited. And obviously if I'm being audited, I'm not going to release a return. As soon as the audit is done, I love it.
Eighty-five percent say you, big difference.
So at the beginning, I said openly to everybody that I contribute to many, many politicians, both Republican and Democrat. And I have, over the years. I'm a businessman. I have, over the years. And I sort of have to laugh when Ted makes a big deal out of the fact that he's doing well in the polls. Well, I'm beating him in virtually every poll. I'm tied in Texas, by the way, which I shouldn't be. But I think I'll do very well. But a poll just came out — a Bloomberg poll — where I am beating him so badly that it's, like, embarrassing even for me to say I'm beating him that badly. And — and here's the thing — it was sort of funny — 65 percent of the people don't like you — I just got 36 percent of the vote, right? I just got 46 percent on another one. I got 38 percent...[ bell ringing ]...on another one. That means — and he got 20 and 22, and he lost in South Carolina so badly — that was going to be his stronghold. He said a year ago, "I can't lose South Carolina." I beat him in a landslide. Last week in Nevada, I beat him in a landslide, and he sank about the polls. One other thing — Hillary Clinton — take a look at USA Today, take a look at the Q poll. I beat her, and I beat her badly. And I — and I haven't even started at her. I only had one little interchange......I only had one little interchange, and that was...[ bell ringing ]...four weeks ago, when she said I was sexist. And believe me, they had a rough weekend that weekend, between Bill and Hillary. They had a rough weekend. 
Nothing.
You — you don't...
I'm not afraid .
... first of all, he's talking about the polls. I'm beating him awfully badly in the polls. 
Well, then, if I can't — if — hey, if I can't beat her, you're really going to get killed, aren't you? So — so let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly. I know you're embarrassed — I know you're embarrassed, but keep fighting — keep swinging, man. Swing for the fences. Let me just tell you — let me just tell you, the Trump University case is a civil case. Not a — it's a civil case. It's a case where people want to try and get — it's a case that is nonsense. It's something I could have settled many times. I could settle it right now for very little money, but I don't want to do it out of principle. The people that took the course all signed — most — many — many signed report cards saying it was fantastic, it was wonderful, it was beautiful. As — and believe me, I'll win that case. That's an easy case. Civil case. Number two, as far as the taxes are concerned, I'm being audited. It's a very routine audit, and it's very unfair, because I've been audited for, I think, over 12 years. Every year, because of the size of my company, which is very, very large, I'm being audited — which is a very large company. [ bell ringing ]
I'm being audited 12 years in a row, at least. Now, until that audit's done, and I don't think anybody would blame me, I'm not giving it...
 audited for those years.
Shocking. 
Right.
Well, first of all, I don't think they do under President Obama because I think he's treated Israel horribly, all right? I think he's treated Israel horribly. I was the grand marshall down 5th Avenue a number of years ago for the Israeli Day Parade, I have very close ties to Israel. I've received the Tree of Life Award and many of the greatest awards given by Israel. As president, however, there's nothing that I would rather do to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors generally. And I think it serves no purpose to say that you have a good guy and a bad guy. Now, I may not be successful in doing it. It's probably the toughest negotiation anywhere in the world of any kind. OK? But it doesn't help if I start saying, "I am very pro-Israel, very pro, more than anybody on this stage." But it doesn't do any good to start demeaning the neighbors, because I would love to do something with regard to negotiating peace, finally, for Israel and for their neighbors. And I can't do that as well — as a negotiator, I cannot do that as well if I'm taking big, big sides. With that being said, I am totally pro-Israel.
Well, I can only say — look, I can only say I've been a big contributor to Israel over the years. I've received many, many awards from Israel, as I've said before. I have a great relationship with Israel. And I'm going to keep it that way. And if I could bring peace, that would be a fantastic thing. It would be one of my greatest achievements as president.
I'm a negotiator. I've done very well over the years through negotiation. It's very important that we do that. In all fairness, Marco is not a negotiator. I watched him melt down and I'll tell you, it was one of the saddest things I've ever seen. He's not going down — excuse me...
... wait a minute, and these people may even be tougher than Chris Christie. OK?
OK, no, no, no — a deal is a deal. Let me tell you that. I learned a long time ago.
You are not a negotiator. You are not a negotiator. And, with your thinking, you will never bring peace. You will never bring peace...
... Excuse me, I want to be able to bring peace...
He will never be able to do it. I think I may be able to do it, although I will say this. Probably the toughest deal of any kind is that particular deal.
One thing I'd like to add to what the Governor's saying, I think that we are now in a position — are $19 trillion dollars because of the horrible omnibus budget that was approved six weeks ago, it's going to be $21 trillion dollars. We can no longer defend all of these countries, Japan, Germany, South Korea. You order televisions, you order almost anything, you're getting it from these countries. Whether it's a Mercedes-Benz, or whether it's an air conditioning unit. They're coming out of these countries. They are making a fortune. Saudi Arabia, we are defending Saudi Arabia. Before the oil went down, now they're making less, but they're making plenty. They were making $1 billion dollars a day. [ bell ringing ] We defend all of these countries for peanuts. You talk about budgets. We have to start getting reimbursed for taking care of the military services for all of these countries. 
I really don't because it not working and the countries aren't agreeing to it and the rebels aren't agreeing and Syria is not agreeing. So It's a meaningless ceasefire. I love the idea of a ceasefire. I love the idea of — with a total cessation. But it's not working, as you know very well. It's not working. If — we can do what we want with Russia but nobody else is adhering to it. So I certainly support it, I would certainly love it, but all parties have to be part of it.
Again, I think I gave them both checks to be exactly honest. I think they both liked me very much. But the fact is that ...
Well, I think Bush did a hell of a bad as far as that's concerned. You know it and so do I.
Be honest. Be honest. No, this was before. The check came early. But let me just tell you, Syria, he's saying that I was in favor of Syria. He said I was in favor of Libya? I never discussed that subject. I was in favor of Libya? We would be so much better off if Gadhafi were in charge right now. If these politicians went to the beach and didn't do a thing, and we had Saddam Hussein and if we had Gadhafi in charge, instead of having terrorism all over the place, we'd be — at least they killed terrorists, all right? And I'm not saying they were good because they were bad, they were really bad, but we don't know what we're getting. You look at Libya right now,
I never said walk away. I wouldn't want to walk away. I want them to pay us much more money. We cannot afford to subsidize...
A lot. I'll negotiate a lot more money than you'll ever get. As far as John Kerry is concerned, there has been no tougher critic of this man, I think he negotiated one of the worst deals in the history of our country, the Iran deal, where they get their $150 billion and all of the other things that take place. It is a disaster for this country, and speaking of Israel, it's a disaster for Israel. I'm no fan of John Kerry. 
Well, look, my response is very simple. There is nobody on this stage that has done more for Israel than I have. Nobody. You might say, you might talk, you're politicians, all talk, no action. I've been watching it all my life. You are all talk and no action.
What I've seen up here — I mean, first of all, this guy is a choke artist, and this guy is a liar. You have a combination...
You have a combination of factors. He can't do it...
... for the obvious reason, and he can't do it because he doesn't know how to tell the truth. Other than that, I rest my case. 
I watched — I watched......the lobbyists. I watched what this man did to Dr. Ben Carson, who I respect, in Iowa, where he said that Ben Carson is out of the race — he has left Iowa and he's out of the race. And I thought it was disgraceful. And got a lot of votes because of that — a lot of votes. Took them away from Ben Carson. I watched that. Probably took them away from me, too. But I watched it. I also watched where he did a forum that looked like it came right out of a government agency, and it said on top, "Voter Violation," and then it graded you...[ bell ringing ]...and it scared the hell out of people, and it said the only way you clear up the violation, essentially, is to go and vote for Ted Cruz. I watched that fraudulent document, and I said it's the worst thing I've ever seen in politics. [ bell ringing ] To me, that was even worse than what he did to Ben.
I know politicians — I know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do. And it's not good.
I funded you. I funded him. Can you believe it? 
I funded this guy. I gave him a check.
I gave him a check. He never funded me.
You know why? I didn't want to, but he sent me his book with his autograph...
Mr. Trump, you're doing a great job. I have his book. 
Thank you — thank you for the book. Go ahead.
This is a lot of fun up here tonight, I have to tell you. Thank — thank you for the book. I really appreciate it.
Go ahead. I'm relaxed. You're the basket case. Go ahead.
Go ahead. Don't get nervous.
Go ahead. 
I've seen you.
You're losing so badly you — I want to...
... I — you don't know what's happening. 
First of all, you're talking about a border that's many, many times longer. You're talking about a massive border. We have far less problem with that border than we do with our Southern border, and tremendous amounts — you know, I won, I had the privilege of winning by a landslide, by the way, New Hampshire. You go to New Hampshire, the first thing they talk about is heroin and drugs pouring in. And, you wouldn't think this beautiful place — it's beautiful. With the trees and the roads, and the countryside. Their biggest problem is heroin, and it's such a shame to see it. They're pouring in from the Southern border, so I'm talking about great security. I'm talking about a wall that can absolutely be built, and I'll build it on time, on budget. It'll be a very high wall, a great wall. It's going to be built, it's going to be built. It's going to be paid for by Canada, by the way — maybe I'll get Canada to pay? Got to be paid for by Mexico. The problem with Canada, you're talking about a massively long piece. You're talking about a border that would be about four times longer. It would be very, very hard to do, and we — it is not our biggest problem. I don't care what anyone says. It is not our big problem. Our big problem is not only people coming in, and in many cases the wrong people, it's the tremendous amount of drugs that are coming in. 
Thank you. Nobody knows politicians better than I do. They're all talk, they're no action, nothing gets done. I've watched it for years. Take a look at what's happening to our country. All of the things that I've been talking about, whether it's trade, whether it's building up our depleted military, whether it's taking care of our vets, whether it's getting rid of Common Core, which is a disaster, or knocking out Obamacare and coming up with something so much better, I will get it done. Politicians will never, ever get it done. And we will make America great again. Thank you.
