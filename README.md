# Trump Campaign Speech and Debate Transcripts

This is a structured version of the transcripts of Donald Trump's campaign speeches and debate transcripts, as provided by the [The American Presidency Project](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php) at UC Santa Barbara.

The speeches (called "Remarks" on the USCB site, [source page](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/2016_election_speeches.php?candidate=45&campaign=2016TRUMP&doctype=5000)) are transcribed verbatim from the site. Although I have not verified how exhaustive the list of speeches is, this dataset contains a large number of Trump's campaign rally speeches from June 2015 through November 2016. It also includes his Republican Convention acceptance speech in July 2016. 


The debate transcripts ([source page](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/debates.php)) have been processed to include only the portions of the transcript attributable to Donald Trump.
